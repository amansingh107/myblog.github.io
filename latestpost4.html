      <h2>Ray-esque | Satyajit Ray: Interesting Anecdotes</h2>
      <p class="meta">Posted on <span class="date">July 7, 2023</span> by <span class="author">Ashok Nage</span></p>
      <p>“Father had read the short story quite some time ago and after scripting the film, he was convinced that it was tailor made for Tulshi Chakraborty. After browsing through the screenplay, Tulshibabu was on Cloud Nine. He was elated. Father’s screenplay deviated quite a bit from the original writing. This is because my father had converted a short story into a full-fledged film. But, that didn’t prevent Parasuram, Paras Pathar’s author, from being joyous watching the cinematic transcreation of his writing. He expressed to Ray that he had never imagined that the maestro would reel out such a film from his short story. ‘You have brought off a great job’, he told father,” expresses Sandip.

        Sandip informs: “Father felt it was a sheer delight to work with Tulshi Chakraborty. The cocktail party sequence is still crystal clear in my memory. Father had contracted an eye infection when the shooting was on. So, he was wearing dark glasses. Even the production photographs of that time find him wearing dark glasses. Father had ordered the costumes and a prince-coat for Tulshibabu for the cocktail sequence. Going by the manner in which he scheduled his scenes and did his homework, everyone knew in advance about this sequence and other scenes.”
        
        But, Tulshi Chakraborty was unaware of his dress for the cocktail party. When he entered the make-up room and saw that instead of his customary dhoti and half-shirt, which he wore in many a film earlier, a prince-coat was slung around a hanger. The cream of Tollygunge had performed in the cocktail party sequence from Chhabi Bisawas to Pahari Sanyal and Chandrabati Devi to Renuka Ray. The complete galaxy. So, Tulshi Chakraborty had initially concluded that the prince-coat was meant for one of the top stars. But, when he was finally made to wear it, he broke into tears.
        
        “On being informed of this incident, father rushed to the make-up room perturbed and found Tulshi Chakraborty crying. Tulshibabu affectionately clasped father’s hands and said it was an unprecedented incident in his life. This moving and memorable experience was never to be erased from my father’s mind. It had never occurred in his life,” emotes Sandip. “He couldn’t shoot for a while during the film after that episode. He hadn’t imagined that someone so gifted, yet self-effacing like Tulshi Chakraborty could be part of the film industry.”</p>
        <p>“Everytime we spoke about Tulshi Chakraborty later, father would narrate this moment. When one works with an actor throughout a film, you get to familiarise yourself very closely with him as a human being. His attitudes and his behavioral approach. Unfortunately, when people dropped by to interview father, they didn’t talk about Paras Pathar much. They dwelt more naturally on the likes of the Apu Trilogy or Charulata. Paras Pathar was considered a lesser film. In fact, it also didn’t impress at the box-office,” Sandip says. “But, when there was a revival of the film in Calcutta in the eighties, everyone was floored by the film. This has been seen in many of father’s films whether it be Jalshaghar or Kanchengungha which were ahead of their time.”

            In early-2000, a complete retrospective of father’s films, including shorts, was fielded in France’s Nantes city at various theatres. Sandip and his wife, Lolita, were present at the retro. “It was a phenomenal success. And, Jalshaghar ran to packed theatres. Then, there was another screening of Agantuk (The Stranger) at the Provence festival in France after father passed away. We were there along with writers Sunil Gangopadhyay and Amitav Ghosh and photographer Marc Riboud and Krishna Riboud together with others.
            
            “After Provence, we travelled to Paris. I was looking around for good films on VHS because the early nineties was the age of VHS. Someone advised me to visit a store which offered interesting films. On reaching the store, I was looking around. Suddenly, I stumbled upon an entire rack in a shelf stacked with father’s films. I was immensely moved. This proved the popularity of father’s movies in France,” elates Sandip.
            
            “Another facet which people found difficult fathoming is father’s equation with children. He used to climb down to their level and enter into an adda (chat) session. He became their friend and never allowed them to sense that difference in years. He made them feel that they could pose any question to him. During Sonar Kella (The Golden Fortress), we scoured Rajasthan in the car or bus. Kushal (Chakraborty), the child artiste, then seven or eight years old, used to sit beside father and ask various questions. And, father would respond to every question of his. The children always gave their best for their father. Very few directors have handled children as efficiently as father,” Sandip exudes. Kushal expressed later when he had grown in years, that he realised to what extent he had troubled the master in the midst of all his work. “That was father’s magic. Of making a child easy and confident of facing the camera and bringing off their act,” Sandip adds.</p>
