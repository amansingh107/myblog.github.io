            When we’re writing web content, we have to keep many things in our mind. At first, always start with keyword research for SEO. Keyword stuffing is the next thing.Although SEO should always be a focal point, if we stuff keywords into our copy we’ll negatively impact the readability of our content, its known as the conversion rate and how well it ranks in the SERPs. If we stuff keywords into our copy, readers will bounce off the page and search engines will slap us down. Always hyperlink to our sources is the main thing to be done.

When we reference another website’s content, make sure we hyperlink back to that site. Make the reader happy for our best content. If we’ve read tips about writing for the web before, we’re probably familiar with the term passive voice .The passive voice happens when we switch the subject and object in a sentence. If we’re writing the next Great American Novel, it’s okay to end paragraphs when pauses seem natural. Writing for the web, however, is a whole different world.

Put simply: keep it short can attract others. Every single page on our website should link to other pages, not only does this help us boost the rankings of the pages we link to, but also gets users hopping around on our site and spending more time there. Most writers will keep this in mind when creating web content, but what they’ll often forget to do is revisit older posts and pages to update them with new links, but it’s the most wanted thing here. Set a Google Calendar alert for our self so we’ll remember to do this once a month. SEO is really all about ripping apart raw data and seeing what ROI we can pull out of it.

When it comes to analyzing the keywords and traffic data of any website, it’s really easy to get lost in the analytics. This is especially true when it comes to certain SEO tools out there that either bombard us with data. Alternatively, there are other tools that don’t show us the raw data at all: instead, they break everything down into their own proprietary system. All of the big analytics include what keywords we’re ranking for, how many backlinks we have, what our competition looks like, and what the total ad value of your keywords amounts to etc. Our content writing should always offer value to the reader in terms of insightful ideas and actionable tips. But if we really want our site to earn repeat traffic and rise in search engine rankings, develop the accurate content. Having excellent copy on our website is one of the easiest ways to grab the attention of new visitors and keep them coming back.
